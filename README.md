```

NOTE: npm commands overwrite the ./public directory.

Project's source files are placed in ./src/ directory.

- ./src/assets - default static files (eg. image placeholders). You should replace them with your own files.
- ./src/tailwind/ - Tailwind config file used to build the theme. Variables used in Theme Customizer are located in tailwind.config.js file.

All your pages (templates) are stored in separate .pug files.

- ./src/pug/\*.pug
